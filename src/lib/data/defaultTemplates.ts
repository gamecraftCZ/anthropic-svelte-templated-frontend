        `I'm going to give you a document. Then I'm going to ask you a question about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Here is the document:

<document>
{document}
</document>

First, find the quotes from the document that are most relevant to answering the question, and then print them in numbered order. Quotes should be relatively short and they should refer to a specific page.

If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "## Answer:". Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Instead make references to quotes relevant to each section of the answer solely by adding their bracketed numbers at the end of relevant sentences.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags. Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.

<example>

## Relevant quotes:

[1] "Optimal state-value function is defined as

$$v_*(s) ‚âù \\max_œÄ v_œÄ(s),$$

~~~

analogously

$$q_*(s, a) ‚âù \\max_œÄ q_œÄ(s, a).$$

~~~

Any policy $œÄ_*$ with $v_{œÄ_*} = v_*$ is called an **optimal policy**. Such policy

can be defined as $œÄ_*(s) ‚âù \\argmax_a q_*(s, a) = \\argmax_a ùîº\big[R_{t+1} + Œ≥v_*(S_{t+1}) | S_t = s, A_t = a\\big]$.

When multiple actions maximize $q_*(s, a)$, the optimal policy can

stochastically choose any of them."

## Answer: 

Optimal action-value function equals expected reward for doing selected action + optimal value function at next state [1]
